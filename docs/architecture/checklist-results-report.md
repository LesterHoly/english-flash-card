# Checklist Results Report

Before completing this architecture document, I recommend executing the architect checklist to validate all architectural decisions. This will ensure:

✅ **Technology Stack Validation:** Confirm all chosen technologies align with educational app requirements and team capabilities

✅ **Security Review:** Verify authentication, authorization, and data protection measures meet educational standards

✅ **Performance Validation:** Ensure response time targets and scalability projections are realistic

✅ **Integration Testing:** Confirm all external API integrations (OpenAI, Supabase) have proper error handling and fallbacks

✅ **Deployment Readiness:** Validate CI/CD pipeline, monitoring setup, and rollback procedures

✅ **Documentation Completeness:** Ensure all critical architectural decisions are documented with rationale

✅ **Cost Analysis:** Review projected costs for OpenAI API usage, Vercel hosting, and Supabase services
