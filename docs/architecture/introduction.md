# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **English Flash Cards Generator**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Assessment

**Status:** N/A - Greenfield project  

**Analysis:** Based on the PRD, this is a new English Flash Cards Generator application. However, given the tech stack requirements (Next.js + Chakra UI + Supabase + Vercel), I recommend considering the following starter templates to accelerate development:

1. **Next.js + Supabase Starter** - Official Supabase/Vercel templates with authentication pre-configured
2. **T3 Stack** - TypeScript, Next.js, tRPC, Prisma/Supabase - excellent for type-safe full-stack apps
3. **Chakra UI Templates** - Pre-built layouts and components for educational applications

**Recommendation:** Use Supabase's official Next.js starter as the foundation, then integrate Chakra UI for the component system. This provides authentication, database setup, and Vercel deployment configuration out-of-the-box.

**Architectural Constraints:** The PRD specifies fixed requirements for Next.js, Chakra UI, Supabase, and Vercel deployment, so any starter must be compatible with this tech stack.
