- Visual workflow canvas for maintenance
- Category expansion capabilities

## First Principles Analysis - Core Components

### Visual Evidence
The user provided two excellent example outputs showing the target quality and format:
- **Single Word Card:** "insect" with 4 contextual scenes and sentences
- **Category Card:** "Insects" with 6 labeled items (bee, fly, bug, ant, worm) in thematic layout

### Fundamental Building Blocks Identified

#### 1. Input Processing Layer
- **Word/Category Input Handler**
- **Input Type Classifier** (single word vs category)
- **Category Expansion Logic** (昆虫 → ant, bee, bug, fly, worm, spider)

#### 2. AI Integration Layer
- **Text Generation Module** (category expansion, sentence creation)
- **Image Generation Module** (DALL-E/Midjourney/Stable Diffusion)
- **Prompt Template Engine** (different templates for single vs category cards)

#### 3. Card Generation Engine

- **Output Display** (preview, download, batch generation)
- **Workflow Canvas** (visual process management)

## Morphological Analysis - Technical Architecture Matrix

### Backend Architecture Selection
**User Choice:** ✅ **Microservices** with focus on **Scaling Requirements**

**Rationale:** Microservices architecture selected for:
- Independent scaling of AI-intensive components (image generation vs text processing)
- Isolated failure handling (if image API fails, text generation continues)
- Technology flexibility per service
- Future extensibility (adding new card types, AI providers)

### Service Breakdown Analysis
**High-Traffic Services** (need aggressive scaling):
- Image Generation Service (computationally expensive)
- Card Assembly Service (combines all elements)

**Medium-Traffic Services:**
- Text Generation Service (category expansion, sentence creation)
- Template Management Service (prompt variations)

**Low-Traffic Services:**
- User Interface Service
- Configuration Management

### AI Integration Strategy Selection
**User Choices:**
- **Text Generation:** ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4** 
- **Image Generation:** ✅ **OpenAI GPT-4O** (vision capabilities)
- **Integration Pattern:** ✅ **Multi-Provider**
- **Scaling Approach:** **No aggressive scaling requirements** (different from initial assumption)

**Strategic Analysis:**
- **OpenAI Ecosystem Advantage:** Unified API, consistent quality, shared rate limits
- **Multi-Provider Safety Net:** Backup providers for resilience
- **Simplified Architecture:** Less complex than initially planned microservices

**Cost-Benefit Assessment:**
- Lower operational complexity vs. potential vendor lock-in
- Consistent style across text + image generation
- Easier prompt engineering with single provider context

### Revised Architecture Implications
**Scaling Strategy Shift:** From aggressive microservices to **streamlined services** with OpenAI focus
- Image Service: GPT-4O vision + DALL-E fallback
