# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Next.js application)
**Frameworks**: Next.js 13+ with App Router, React, Chakra UI component library
**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + authentication + real-time capabilities)
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment optimized for Next.js applications
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI API (GPT-4 + GPT-4O), image generation and processing libraries

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: No database schema changes required - preview functionality operates on generated card data in memory before saving to user library

**API Integration Strategy**: Preview intercepts existing generation API responses without modifying endpoints - adds client-side display layer between generation completion and download

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Modal component integrates with current generation workflow using React Context for state management, preserving existing component hierarchy and routing structure

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Preview components follow existing testing patterns using Jest/React Testing Library, with additional tests for modal interactions and card display scaling

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Preview components follow existing structure - `/components/preview/` directory with `CardPreviewModal.tsx`, `PreviewActions.tsx`, and related hooks in `/hooks/usePreview.ts`

**Naming Conventions**: Follow established camelCase for components, kebab-case for files, and TypeScript interface naming with `I` prefix for consistency with current codebase

**Coding Standards**: Maintain existing ESLint/Prettier configuration, TypeScript strict mode, and component composition patterns established in current Chakra UI implementation

**Documentation Standards**: JSDoc comments for components, README updates for new preview workflow, and integration notes in existing component documentation

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: No build process changes required - preview components compile with existing Next.js build pipeline and Chakra UI optimization

**Deployment Strategy**: Feature flag controlled deployment allows gradual rollout and instant rollback capability through environment variables

**Monitoring and Logging**: Preview interactions logged through existing analytics integration, error tracking for modal display and generation pipeline integration

**Configuration Management**: Preview settings stored in existing user preferences system via Supabase, with default configurations manageable through environment variables

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- Modal display issues on various screen sizes affecting card preview quality
- Performance impact from large image rendering in modal overlay
- State management complexity between generation and preview workflows

**Integration Risks**:
- Disruption to existing quick generation workflow reducing user satisfaction
- Compatibility issues with current Chakra UI version and modal implementations
- User confusion with new workflow steps affecting adoption

**Deployment Risks**:
- Feature flag misconfiguration causing preview system to interfere with production generation
- Browser compatibility issues with modal and image scaling across different devices

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive responsive testing across Chakra UI breakpoints before deployment
- Performance monitoring with image optimization and lazy loading implementation
- Feature flag architecture enabling instant rollback to previous generation workflow
- User onboarding tooltips and optional tutorial for preview system introduction
