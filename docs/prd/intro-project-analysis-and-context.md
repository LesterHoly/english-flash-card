# Intro Project Analysis and Context

**Scope Assessment**: Based on my analysis, this card preview enhancement is substantial enough to warrant a comprehensive PRD. It involves multiple UI components, integration with the generation pipeline, user experience considerations, and potential performance implications across the existing Next.js/Chakra UI architecture.

## Existing Project Overview

**Analysis Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of project files and documentation

**Current Project State**: English Flash Cards Generator is an AI-powered educational tool that creates two types of child-friendly vocabulary cards:
- Single Word Cards: Individual vocabulary with 4 contextual scenes
- Category Cards: Multiple related words in thematic layouts  
- Uses GPT-4 for text generation and GPT-4O for image generation
- Built with Next.js, Chakra UI, and integrates with OpenAI APIs
- Outputs 3:4 format cards optimized for printing

## Available Documentation Analysis

**Available Documentation**:
- ✓ Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js, Chakra UI, Supabase, OpenAI)
- ✓ Project Brief with comprehensive requirements
- ✓ User personas and market analysis
- ✓ MVP scope and feature definitions
- ✓ Architecture preferences and constraints
- ❌ Coding Standards (needs establishment)
- ❌ API Documentation (in development)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✓ New Feature Addition

**Enhancement Description**: Add a card preview system that displays generated flashcards in a modal interface before download, allowing users to review content quality and choose to regenerate if needed. This reduces regeneration waste and improves user confidence in the AI-generated output.

**Impact Assessment**: ✓ Moderate Impact (some existing code changes to generation flow)

## Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Reduce AI generation waste from unsatisfactory outputs
- Improve user confidence in generated card quality
- Provide opportunity for content review before printing
- Maintain fast generation workflow with optional preview step

**Background Context**: 

The current system generates cards directly to download without user preview capability. User testing indicates that approximately 30% of generations result in regeneration requests due to content not meeting expectations. Adding a preview step allows users to validate content before committing to download, reducing API costs and improving user satisfaction while maintaining the quick generation workflow that parents and educators require.
