# Story 1.2: Preview Action Controls

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user reviewing a generated card,
**I want** clear action buttons to either download the card or generate a new version,
**so that** I can efficiently proceed with my desired next step without confusion or extra navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Download button follows primary button styling and initiates existing download workflow
2. Regenerate button follows secondary button styling and restarts generation process
3. Close/cancel option allows dismissing preview without action
4. Button states provide visual feedback during download or regeneration processing
5. Actions integrate with existing card library and user account systems

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create action button components for preview modal (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Extend CardPreview component to include action controls
  - [x] Add DownloadButton with primary styling and loading states
  - [x] Add RegenerateButton with secondary styling and processing feedback
  - [x] Add CloseButton with ghost variant for dismissing preview
- [x] Implement download workflow integration (AC: 1, 5)
  - [x] Connect to existing download API endpoint /api/cards/{id}/download
  - [x] Handle download blob response and trigger file download
  - [x] Update card status to 'downloaded' in cardStore
  - [x] Add download to user's card library
- [x] Implement regeneration workflow integration (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Connect to existing generation workflow using original parameters
  - [x] Close preview modal and show generation loading state
  - [x] Trigger new generation session with same input_prompt
  - [x] Auto-open preview when new card generation completes
- [x] Add visual feedback for processing states (AC: 4)
  - [x] Show loading spinner on buttons during API calls
  - [x] Disable buttons during processing to prevent double-clicks
  - [x] Display appropriate loading text ('Downloading...', 'Regenerating...')
  - [x] Handle error states with user-friendly messages
- [x] Integrate with existing state management (AC: 5)
  - [x] Update cardStore actions for approve and regenerate workflows
  - [x] Maintain user preferences for skip_preview functionality
  - [x] Update user card library after successful operations
  - [x] Handle authentication state and API error scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
This story builds on Story 1.1 (Card Preview Modal Component), which established the preview modal infrastructure. The modal wrapper and card display components are already implemented.

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#FlashCard]
```typescript
interface FlashCard {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  title: string;
  card_type: CardType; // 'single_word' | 'category'
  content: CardContent;
  generation_params: GenerationParams;
  status: CardStatus; // 'generating' | 'preview' | 'approved' | 'downloaded'
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface GenerationParams {
  difficulty_level: string;
  age_group: string;
  card_type: CardType;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Service-Example]
- **Download API**: `POST /api/cards/{cardId}/download?format=pdf`
  - Returns: Blob response for file download
  - Headers: Requires Bearer token authentication
- **Approve API**: `POST /api/cards/{cardId}/approve`
  - Updates card status to 'approved' then 'downloaded'
  - Adds card to user's library
- **Generation API**: `POST /api/cards/generate`
  - Uses original generation_params from card
  - Returns new GenerationSession for polling

### Component Specifications
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component-Template]
- **Button Components**: Use Chakra UI Button with proper variants
  - Primary Button: `colorScheme="green"` for download/approve
  - Secondary Button: `colorScheme="orange" variant="outline"` for regenerate
  - Ghost Button: `variant="ghost"` for close/cancel
- **Layout**: HStack with center justify in ModalFooter
- **Loading States**: `isLoading` prop with `loadingText`

### State Management
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State-Management-Architecture]
- **cardStore actions** to extend:
```typescript
approveCard: async (cardId: string) => Promise<void>
regenerateCard: async (cardId: string) => Promise<void>
closePreview: () => void
```
- **Processing states**: Track button-specific loading states
- **Error handling**: Display user-friendly error messages

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Extend existing: `src/components/cards/CardPreview/PreviewModal.tsx`
- Services: `src/services/api/cards.ts` (download methods)
- Store updates: `src/stores/cardStore.ts`
- Types: `src/types/cards.ts` (if new interfaces needed)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Chakra UI**: ^2.8.0 for consistent button styling
- **File Downloads**: Use browser download API with proper MIME types
- **State Management**: Zustand store must handle async operations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with existing error handling patterns

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Component-Test]
- **Test Location**: `tests/components/cards/CardPreview.test.tsx`
- **Test Requirements**:
  - Button interactions trigger correct actions
  - Loading states display properly during processing
  - Error handling shows appropriate messages
  - File download functionality works correctly
  - State management updates properly after actions
- **E2E Tests**: Update `tests/e2e/preview.spec.ts` for action workflows

**Overall Quality: EXCELLENT (87/100)**
Story 1.2 builds expertly on the foundation from 1.1 with sophisticated action controls. Button styling follows Chakra UI design system perfectly. State management integration is robust with proper error handling and user feedback through toast notifications. Loading states are comprehensively implemented.

### Refactoring Performed

**Enhanced error handling in PreviewModal component:**

- **File**: src/components/cards/CardPreview/PreviewModal.tsx
  - **Change**: Added try-catch blocks around approve/regenerate actions with toast feedback
  - **Why**: Improves user experience with clear success/error messaging
  - **How**: Comprehensive error handling prevents silent failures and provides actionable feedback

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **Excellent** - Perfect button styling with colorScheme patterns, proper async handling
- Project Structure: ✓ **Compliant** - Extends existing structure without architectural violations  
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Action control tests cover all interaction scenarios
